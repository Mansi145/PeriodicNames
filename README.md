# Periodic Names
This is my personal project that I made with Python for fun.
## Description
This project takes in your name or any word you want to type and gives the output of the _names_ of the elements in the periodic table which are present in your name.
This is a short piece of code that can run on any Python console but I'd prefer using PyCharm on which it was written.
