# Periodic Names
This is my personal project that I made with Python for fun.
## Description
The project is inspired from the show "Breaking Bad" where the rolling credits displays names with the element in their name highlighted.
This takes in your name or any word you want to type and gives the output of the _names_ of the elements in the periodic table which are present in your name.
This is a short piece of code that can run on any Python console but I'd prefer using PyCharm on which it was written.
